PROBLEM STATEMENT of the website : RECOMMENDING MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS THROUGH ONLINE PORTAL

It is the era of smartphones and internet. But there is a scarcity of doctors in rural or backward areas. . If we
can connect doctors with patients through online application where patients will input their symptoms
and the doctors will be assigned accordingly, the problem will be resolved. This initiative can be a great way
to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers in these areas.

In India, where there are only 0.7 doctors per 1000 people, our website can provide a convenient platform
for patients to seek medical advice from qualified doctors without having to travel long distances. Patients
can input their symptoms and medical history into the application, and the system can assign them a
doctor accordingly.

Apart from recommending doctors, we will be providing general medicines for regular diseases, which can
be delivered to the patient's doorstep. This can be especially useful for patients who may not have access to
a pharmacy or have difficulty traveling to one. Furthermore, we will have a 24/7 emergency corridor for
patients with severe symptoms. This can help save lives in critical situations where timely medical
intervention is necessary.
